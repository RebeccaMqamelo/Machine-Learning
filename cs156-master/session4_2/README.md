## 4.2 Fisher's Linear Discriminant

## Study Guide

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique that projects data on a discriminant such that it maximizes the difference between classes. 

To calculate LDA, you need to (1) calculate the between-class distance, (2) calculate the within-class distance and (3) construct a lower dimensional space in which between-class distance is maximized and within-class distance is minimized.

The following graphics from the Raschka (2014) reading and Lavrenko (2014) video, respectively, are helpful for differentiating between PCA and LDA.

- Describe in your own words how LDA is different from PCA. You might want to fill in the table below in order to clearly outline some of the main differences.
- List the assumptions that underlie LDA, and describe when LDA might not be appropriate.
- Describe in your own words what happens to Fisher's na√Øve Linear Discriminant if there are fewer data points than dimensions.

## Pre-class work

### 1. Discriminating Fashion

Using your dataset from the previous class (4.1) perform an LDA analysis of your dataset. Project the data down to a single dimension, and find the best classification accuracy that you can get on your dataset.

Upload your code to your pre-class work repository before class, and be prepared to discuss your results during the class.
