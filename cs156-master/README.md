### Machine Learning for Science and Profit

Students learn to apply core machine learning techniques — such as classification, perceptron, neural networks, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and nonparametric models of clustering — as well as fundamental concepts such as feature selection, cross-validation and over-fitting. Students program machine learning algorithms to make sense of a wide range of data, such as genetic data, data used to perform customer segmentation or data used to predict the outcome of elections.
