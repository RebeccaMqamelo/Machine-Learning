## 8.2 Maximum Margin Learning

## Study Guide

After watching the lecture you should be able to:

- Describe the equation that is used to classify a point, and any special properties of that equation when evaluated on a support vector.
- Give a short derivation of the width of the margin in a linearly-separable maximum margin classifier.

## Pre-class work

### 1. Computational Scaling of SVMs

1. Write a Python function from which you can generate synthetic datasets of an arbitrary size (e.g. a mixture model of two Gaussians).
2. By training SVMs on datasets of different sizes show:
   1. How the training time scales
   2. How the classification time scales (on a sample of 1000 unseen data points)
   3. The accuracy of the classifier (on a sample of 1000 unseen data points)

Choose a kernel that you think is appropriate to the task at hand. Come to class with your code and results in a plaintext format suitable for pasting into a poll.
