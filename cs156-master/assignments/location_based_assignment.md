# Location Based Assignment:

## Assignment instructions:

### Principle Landmarks

For this LBA you will need to take at least 20 photos of your favorite landmark. These photos need to be as close to identical as possible, but they need to be taken during the day and over a period of at least 4 hours. Something that creates a time-lapse of your favorite landmark would be ideal, but is not necessary.

Now write code that does the following:

- Processes all photos down to a size not exceeding 512 pixels in either width or height
- Using principal components analysis (PCA) project your images down to a 2 dimensional representation
- Visually inspect the 2D locations of each photo in the new space
- Show the reconstruction from each low-dimensional representation
- Finally, pick a point that is far away from any known location and plot its reconstruction

If you perform any other image processing steps, please clearly note them in your report. This is meant to be a reasonably light-hearted assignment, so feel free to pick irreverent landmarks or use interesting image processing techniques to find artistic reconstructions. You may also try to conduct this assignment in three dimensions, but no higher!

Hand in a single PDF containing all your results and a short discussion of your findings. 

Make sure to include:

- at least 10 of your small photos and their associated reconstructions
- the scatterplot of all images in the 2D space, and where your new point is
- the reconstruction from your new point
